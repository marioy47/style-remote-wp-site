# Preview style changes of local files on remote sites

This is a development tool that allow you to preview CSS and JS changes, done by local files, on remote sites.

It achieves this by creating a local proxy that retrieves the remote's site html/css/js, and then injects the contents of local CSS and JS files to the browser. This way you can preview how the directives of local files will look once they are applied to the remote site.

This tool will use WordPress linting and formatting tools so expect the code to follow WordPress standards.
